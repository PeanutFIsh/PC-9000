PC-9000 is a old computer simulator fully coded in ~~Batch and VBScript~~ (now written in C) also called 90's Computer Simulator.

      - Since I am under Ubuntu 18.04 now, I can't continue this project anymore. It does no have Batch (because it's Linux, no MSDOS). And I lost the J-101 source code I was working on (also same for PCX-1500). I'm probably going to make a rewrite of this project that i've been working for 2 years in C or C++. This gonna be the PCX-1500 and it must have the following features :
         - Full commandline. No GUI
         - Working on Windows' commandline interpreter and Linux Terminal (try to make for both amd64/i386 and arm)
         - New programming language for make boot files and executables (I named it PHONICSCOMPILE but it's probably gonna change)
         - Gotta try to make the simulator as realstic as possible
